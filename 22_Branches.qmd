This is a project and a repository to test Chapter 22 of "happygitwithR", which introduces Branches.

So here I am on my first branch, called 'issue-5' and i can continue my
development and workflows as usual, without disrupting the 'main' branch!

So I continued working on my branch, but my mind wandered and got a really good
idea for the main development part but things in this branch is a huge mess.
I don't have time for sorting these out now and don't want to commit unfinished
bussiness...People are watching!I can either `git stash` but Jenny recommends
to safeguard the current state with a **temporary** commit!

So back to my good iddddd

Phewww, I just commited my great idea on main, and happy to have my temporary 
commit here. Now is time to undo it. Remember i don't want everybody looking 
at my messed version! Let's go for a "mixed", "working directory safe", reset 
for the **LAST** commit.

Perfect, everything is fine, my work is here unstaged and the last commit has been deleted!

In real life I would go back and fix this idddd to idea. Won't happen here for 
demonstration.

This line represents some final touches on issue-5
Forgot a thing or two so this is the line representing some more work! xD
